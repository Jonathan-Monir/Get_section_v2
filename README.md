## Student Schedule Finder
Our University provides a pdf file for each subject where we have to find our subject's ID then our section number then the time of the section. I've made this app where the student types only his seat number and a full timetable for his unique schedule appears in the app for him.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
To start the app, run:
```
streamlit run Schedule_maker.py
```

Once the app is running, simply enter your name or seat number in the input field and click the "Submit" button. The app will retrieve your schedule from the university's system and display it in a table format.

Contributions
Contributions are always welcome! If you have any ideas for improving the app, please feel free to submit a pull request.
